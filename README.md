Fuck That Dconf Command - dconf is really annoying, let's make a wrapper that reads some text file to set things up

## why ?

Every time, I seat in front of a GNOME or MATE desktop, I get pissed off. I have to click my way through a million of 
dialog boxes to make my desktop usable for my taste. 

This is not UNIX! This should have a been a single config file which I can put in git and take everywhere with me. 

So this is an attempt to fix this. 

## Using

To be done

## Installing

To be done

## Tech stuff

Python, YAML. I think that will be enough.
